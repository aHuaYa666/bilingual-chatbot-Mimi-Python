# Mimi's Magical Book of Answers 🐾

This is a fun and bilingual chatbot that gives random answers to your yes/no questions, just like a mysterious book of answers. 🌟

## How to Use

1. To use this chatbot, make sure you have a file named 'answers.txt' in the same folder. If the file is missing, the chatbot won't be able to provide answers. You can create your own or use the sample file we provided.
2. Run the chatbot by executing the Python file.
3. Your conversations can be automatically saved as mimi_transcript_[timestamp].txt when you exit.

## Tips for Asking Questions

Mimi is still learning — she's not quite ready to answer complicated or philosophical questions yet.

For now, she works best with **yes/no questions** like:
- Should I go for a walk today?
- Is this the right time to make a change?
- Will I get good news soon?

But don't worry — even though her answers start with "Yes", "No", or "Maybe", 
she often adds a fun twist or some playful advice to brighten your day! 🌟

So relax, ask anything light-hearted, and enjoy the magical moment with Mimi 🐾~
